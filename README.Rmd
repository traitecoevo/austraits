`austraits` allow users to access, explore and wrangle data from the AusTraits database in `R`. This package includes several functions such as filtering and pivoting the dataset that we expect will come in handy. 

**For R users**, access and manipulation of the data is assisted with the `austraits` package

**For Python or other users**, the [Zenodo download](https://zenodo.org/record/5112001#collapseTwo) includes a .zip file containing all the data in plain text (.csv files) and associated meta-data 

### Installation

The package is not on CRAN yet and is still under active development. For the current stable release of `austraits`, which has full capabilities of the functions used in vignettes (e.g. plotting functions), use: 

```{r setup, results = 'hide', eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/austraits", dependencies = TRUE, upgrade = "ask")

library(austraits) 
```

Otherwise, for a lightweight installation where dependencies for plotting and the vignettes will not be installed, use:

```{r light, results = 'hide', eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/austraits", upgrade = "ask")
```

In September 2024 austraits functions were revamped to support all [traits.build](https://github.com/traitecoevo/traits.build) compiled databases, rather than being linked to [austraits.build](https://github.com/traitecoevo/austraits.build).

Versions of austraits.build (the AusTraits plant trait database) < 5.0 are no longer supported by the current functions. If you are working with an older version of AusTraits, please install an older version of austraits:

For austraits.build versions 4.2 and older: 
```{r setup, results = 'hide', eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/austraits@53b637c", dependencies = TRUE, upgrade = "ask")

library(austraits)
```

Note, if you are unsure what version of AusTraits you are working with, run:
```{r setup, results = 'hide', eval = FALSE}
austraits$build_info$version
```


### Take a good look at our vignettes! `r emo::ji("eyes")`

In our website, we have also included information about the [structure of the database](https://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits/articles/structure.html), [definitions of the traits](https://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits/articles/dictionary.html) and some [tutorials](https://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits/articles/austraits.html) that uses our functions as well as some `tidyverse` functions to create some commonly used data output formats. We highly recommend starting here before jumping into the database! 

If you prefer to view the vignettes in R, we recommend installing the package with `build_vignettes = TRUE`. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/austraits", 
                        dependencies = TRUE, upgrade = "ask", 
                        build_vignettes = TRUE)

vignette("austraits")
```

### Show us some support `r emo::ji("green heart")`

Please consider citing `austraits`, we would super appreciate it! 

```{r}
citation("austraits")
```

### Behind the scenes `r emo::ji("spanner")`

Check out [austraits.build](http://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits.build/), if you are interested in how AusTraits the database is managed and created

### Find a bug? `r emo::ji("bug")`

Thank you for finding it! Head over to the GitHub Issues tab and let us know about it! We will try to get to it as soon as we can!
