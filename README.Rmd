`austraits` allow users to access, explore and wrangle data from the AusTraits database in `R`. This package includes several functions such as filtering and pivoting the dataset that we expect will come in handy. 

**For R users**, access and manipulation of the data is assisted with the `austraits` package

**For Python or other users**, the [Zenodo download](https://zenodo.org/record/5112001#collapseTwo) includes a .zip file containing all the data in plain text (.csv files) and associated meta-data 

### Installation

The package is not on CRAN yet and is still under active development. You can install the stable version of `austraits` from [GitHub](https://github.com/traitecoevo/austraits):

```{r setup, results = 'hide', eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/austraits", build_vignettes = TRUE)

library(austraits) 
```

### Take a good look at our vignettes! `r emo::ji("eyes")`

In our website, we have also included information about the [structure of the database](https://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits/articles/structure.html), [definitions of the traits](https://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits/articles/dictionary.html) and some [tutorials](https://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits/articles/austraits.html) that uses our functions as well as some `tidyverse` functions to create some commonly used data output formats. We highly recommend starting here before jumping into the database! 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("austraits")
```

### Show us some support `r emo::ji("green heart")`

Please consider citing `austraits`, we would super appreciate it! 

```{r}
citation("austraits")
```

### Find a bug? `r emo::ji("bug")`

Thank you for finding it! Head over to the GitHub Issues tab and let us know about it! We will try to get to it as soon as we can!
