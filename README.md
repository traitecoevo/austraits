`austraits` allow users to access, explore and wrangle data from the
AusTraits database in `R`. This package includes several functions such
as filtering and pivoting the dataset that we expect will come in handy.

### Getting started

The package is not on CRAN yet and is still under active development.
You can install the stable version of `austraits` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/traitecoevo/austraits):

``` r
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("traitecoevo/austraits", build_vignettes = TRUE)

library(austraits) 
```

### Take a good look at our vignettes! üëÄ

In our website, we have also included information about the [structure
of the
database](https://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits/articles/structure.html),
[definitions of the
traits](https://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits/articles/dictionary.html)
and some
[tutorials](https://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits/articles/austraits.html)
that uses our functions as well as some `tidyverse` functions to create
some commonly used data output formats. We highly recommend starting
here before jumping into the database!

``` r
vignette("austraits")
```
