Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software.

The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software. Full details regarding the collection of architectural information are given in Appendix S1.","Study relating variation in architectural properties (leaf angle and leaf size) to cross-species patterns of leaf display, light capture and simulated carbon gain in branching-units of 38 perennial species occurring at two sites in Australian forest.","Two sites were chosen within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney, Australia. Both were temperate forest with a high diversity of shrub species under a moderately open eucalypt canopy. The sites differed in soil fertility (94 vs 440 mg kg-1 total P - Wright et al ., 2001) but had similar average annual rainfall (1220 mm distributed throughout the year) and temperature (22 deg , 13 deg C). The vegetation at the low nutrient site (33 deg 41' 38''S, 151 deg 8'35''E) was fire-prone low open sclerophyll woodland with a species rich understorey of woody shrubs, and emergent eucalypts to 15 m (Rice & Westoby, 1983). The site was last burnt in 1990. The soils are derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone parent material. The vegetation at the higher nutrient site (33 deg 34'44''S, 151 deg 17'32''E) is fire-sensitive closed forest, with an overstorey to 20 m dominated by Syncarpia glomulifera , Eucalyptus umbra and Livistona australis . Woody shrubs, climbers, ferns and cycads dominate the understorey. The soils are derived from a weathered volcanic dyke. Plant growth is continuous throughout the year, although species may exhibit a flush of new growth in spring. Further site details are provided by (Wright et al ., 2001). Hereafter, the sites are referred to as medium LAI (closed forest) and low LAI (open woodland) sites. Sampling At either site, a large number of small to moderate-sized woody perennial shrub species coexist in a similar light environment. Most species exhibit a rigid, sclerophyllous architecture, with comparatively little scope for diurnal or seasonal variation in leaf arrangement (pers. obs.).

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software.

The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software. Full details regarding the collection of architectural information are given in Appendix S1.","Study relating variation in architectural properties (leaf angle and leaf size) to cross-species patterns of leaf display, light capture and simulated carbon gain in branching-units of 38 perennial species occurring at two sites in Australian forest.","Two sites were chosen within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney, Australia. Both were temperate forest with a high diversity of shrub species under a moderately open eucalypt canopy. The sites differed in soil fertility (94 vs 440 mg kg-1 total P - Wright et al ., 2001) but had similar average annual rainfall (1220 mm distributed throughout the year) and temperature (22 deg , 13 deg C). The vegetation at the low nutrient site (33 deg 41' 38''S, 151 deg 8'35''E) was fire-prone low open sclerophyll woodland with a species rich understorey of woody shrubs, and emergent eucalypts to 15 m (Rice & Westoby, 1983). The site was last burnt in 1990. The soils are derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone parent material. The vegetation at the higher nutrient site (33 deg 34'44''S, 151 deg 17'32''E) is fire-sensitive closed forest, with an overstorey to 20 m dominated by Syncarpia glomulifera , Eucalyptus umbra and Livistona australis . Woody shrubs, climbers, ferns and cycads dominate the understorey. The soils are derived from a weathered volcanic dyke. Plant growth is continuous throughout the year, although species may exhibit a flush of new growth in spring. Further site details are provided by (Wright et al ., 2001). Hereafter, the sites are referred to as medium LAI (closed forest) and low LAI (open woodland) sites. Sampling At either site, a large number of small to moderate-sized woody perennial shrub species coexist in a similar light environment. Most species exhibit a rigid, sclerophyllous architecture, with comparatively little scope for diurnal or seasonal variation in leaf arrangement (pers. obs.). All species with flat or simply folded leaves, as assumed by the YPLANT software, were chosen for study. This included 26 species from the low LAI and 12 from the medium LAI site. The first three undamaged individuals of each species encountered further than 10 m away from an access track were sampled. Data were collected between 20 September 2000 and 26 November 2001.

A tuft was defined as all leaves and side branches back to the oldest leaf along a leaf age sequence.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software.

The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software. Full details regarding the collection of architectural information are given in Appendix S1.","Study relating variation in architectural properties (leaf angle and leaf size) to cross-species patterns of leaf display, light capture and simulated carbon gain in branching-units of 38 perennial species occurring at two sites in Australian forest.","Two sites were chosen within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney, Australia. Both were temperate forest with a high diversity of shrub species under a moderately open eucalypt canopy. The sites differed in soil fertility (94 vs 440 mg kg-1 total P - Wright et al ., 2001) but had similar average annual rainfall (1220 mm distributed throughout the year) and temperature (22 deg , 13 deg C). The vegetation at the low nutrient site (33 deg 41' 38''S, 151 deg 8'35''E) was fire-prone low open sclerophyll woodland with a species rich understorey of woody shrubs, and emergent eucalypts to 15 m (Rice & Westoby, 1983). The site was last burnt in 1990. The soils are derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone parent material. The vegetation at the higher nutrient site (33 deg 34'44''S, 151 deg 17'32''E) is fire-sensitive closed forest, with an overstorey to 20 m dominated by Syncarpia glomulifera , Eucalyptus umbra and Livistona australis . Woody shrubs, climbers, ferns and cycads dominate the understorey. The soils are derived from a weathered volcanic dyke. Plant growth is continuous throughout the year, although species may exhibit a flush of new growth in spring. Further site details are provided by (Wright et al ., 2001). Hereafter, the sites are referred to as medium LAI (closed forest) and low LAI (open woodland) sites. Sampling At either site, a large number of small to moderate-sized woody perennial shrub species coexist in a similar light environment. Most species exhibit a rigid, sclerophyllous architecture, with comparatively little scope for diurnal or seasonal variation in leaf arrangement (pers. obs.).

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software.

YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software. Full details regarding the collection of architectural information are given in Appendix S1.","Study relating variation in architectural properties (leaf angle and leaf size) to cross-species patterns of leaf display, light capture and simulated carbon gain in branching-units of 38 perennial species occurring at two sites in Australian forest.","Two sites were chosen within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney, Australia. Both were temperate forest with a high diversity of shrub species under a moderately open eucalypt canopy. The sites differed in soil fertility (94 vs 440 mg kg-1 total P - Wright et al ., 2001) but had similar average annual rainfall (1220 mm distributed throughout the year) and temperature (22 deg , 13 deg C). The vegetation at the low nutrient site (33 deg 41' 38''S, 151 deg 8'35''E) was fire-prone low open sclerophyll woodland with a species rich understorey of woody shrubs, and emergent eucalypts to 15 m (Rice & Westoby, 1983). The site was last burnt in 1990. The soils are derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone parent material. The vegetation at the higher nutrient site (33 deg 34'44''S, 151 deg 17'32''E) is fire-sensitive closed forest, with an overstorey to 20 m dominated by Syncarpia glomulifera , Eucalyptus umbra and Livistona australis . Woody shrubs, climbers, ferns and cycads dominate the understorey. The soils are derived from a weathered volcanic dyke. Plant growth is continuous throughout the year, although species may exhibit a flush of new growth in spring. Further site details are provided by (Wright et al ., 2001). Hereafter, the sites are referred to as medium LAI (closed forest) and low LAI (open woodland) sites. Sampling At either site, a large number of small to moderate-sized woody perennial shrub species coexist in a similar light environment. Most species exhibit a rigid, sclerophyllous architecture, with comparatively little scope for diurnal or seasonal variation in leaf arrangement (pers. obs.).

A tuft was defined as all leaves and side branches back to the oldest leaf along a leaf age sequence.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software.

This level of organisation represents an intermediate scale between the leaf and the whole plant, spanning the full range of leaf ages and reflecting the tendency for plants to consist of repeated architectural units. Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software. Full details regarding the collection of architectural information are given in Appendix S1.","Study relating variation in architectural properties (leaf angle and leaf size) to cross-species patterns of leaf display, light capture and simulated carbon gain in branching-units of 38 perennial species occurring at two sites in Australian forest.","Two sites were chosen within Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, Sydney, Australia. Both were temperate forest with a high diversity of shrub species under a moderately open eucalypt canopy. The sites differed in soil fertility (94 vs 440 mg kg-1 total P - Wright et al ., 2001) but had similar average annual rainfall (1220 mm distributed throughout the year) and temperature (22 deg , 13 deg C). The vegetation at the low nutrient site (33 deg 41' 38''S, 151 deg 8'35''E) was fire-prone low open sclerophyll woodland with a species rich understorey of woody shrubs, and emergent eucalypts to 15 m (Rice & Westoby, 1983). The site was last burnt in 1990. The soils are derived from Hawkesbury Sandstone parent material. The vegetation at the higher nutrient site (33 deg 34'44''S, 151 deg 17'32''E) is fire-sensitive closed forest, with an overstorey to 20 m dominated by Syncarpia glomulifera , Eucalyptus umbra and Livistona australis . Woody shrubs, climbers, ferns and cycads dominate the understorey. The soils are derived from a weathered volcanic dyke. Plant growth is continuous throughout the year, although species may exhibit a flush of new growth in spring. Further site details are provided by (Wright et al ., 2001). Hereafter, the sites are referred to as medium LAI (closed forest) and low LAI (open woodland) sites.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days.

Tufts, as opposed to whole plants, were sampled for practical reasons and in an attempt to provide a sizeindependent unit of comparison across species. The three-dimensional leaf arrangement of each plant was recorded using a FASTRAK 3D-digitizer (Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA), in conjunction with the software package FLORADIG (CSIRO Entomology, Brisbane, Australia). The digitizer includes a magnetic signal receiver and pointer, allowing the user to record the 3D spatial co-ordinates of the pointer within a hemisphere of 3 m diameter from the receiver. Individual plants are digitally reconstructed by recording a series of point co-ordinates, and the relevant connectivity between points. Stem segments and petioles are characterized by their elevation angle, azimuth, length and diameter. Individual leaves are characterized by their length together with the azimuth and elevation angle of two vectors on the lamina surface. YPLANT software (Pearcy & Yang, 1996) was used to estimate light interception and a potential carbon gain for different sample periods throughout a single day and integrated across entire days. The 3D description of leaf arrangement recorded for each tuft in FLORADIG was converted to the appropriate YPLANT format using a program written in C. Sampling time for individual tufts ranged from 20 min to 2.5 h, depending on the number and size of leaves. Although still time consuming, the methods presented here represent a marked acceleration of data collection in architectural studies using the YPLANT software.
