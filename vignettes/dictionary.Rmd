- description: The ovary is the part of the gynoecium where the ovules are produced. The ovary may be located on the receptacle and thus be positioned above the insertion level of the remaining floral organs (i.e., the ovary is superior and the flower is hypogynous). Alternatively, the ovary may be embedded in the receptacle and therefore be located below the insertion level of the remaining floral organs (i.e., the ovary is inferior and the flower is epigynous). Flowers with a hypanthium may either have a superior ovary (perigyny; e.g., many Rosaceae) or an inferior ovary (epiperigyny). It is also possible that the ovary is inferior to a certain degree only, such as half-inferior, if the receptacle is surrounding the ovary to its mid-level. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '102. Ovary position (D1)')

## flower_perianth_parts_count


- label: Number of perianth parts
- description: The total number of perianth parts, including sepals, petals, or any form of tepal. A value of zero was scored when the perianth is absent. In flowers with perianth whorls fused along their complete length (e.g., Convolvulus), perianth parts are counted based on merism (e.g., if a calyx has 5 distinct sepals and the corolla is entirely fused, then the corolla is often interpreted to consist of five fused petals), anatomy (e.g., number of vascular traces), development (e.g., number of primordia), or comparison with closely related taxa. (Definition derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '201. Number of perianth parts (C1)')

## flower_perianth_fusion


- label: Fusion of perianth
- description: Fusion of perianth organs (congenital or postgenital) at anthesis, recorded on a continuous scale, from 0 (free parts) to 1 (parts fused along their entire length). Partial fusion was recorded using an approximate number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the length of perianth parts). In case of multiple whorls, this trait records within-whorl fusion. For example, if organs within each whorl are fused along their entire length, a trait value of 1 is recorded. In cases where organs of two whorls are fused into a common tubular structure, such as frequently observed in monocots (e.g., Polygonatum), the perianth is considered to be fused. If the two (or more) whorls differed in their extent of fusion, a range of trait values may be recorded. For example, if the calyx is only basally fused, up to 10% of its length, but the corolla is entirely fused, a range of 0.1 to 1 is recorded as the trait value for the species. (Definition derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '204. Fusion of perianth (C1)')

## flower_perianth_symmetry


- label: Symmetry of perianth
- description: Trait capturing the symmetry of the perianth. This trait is applied to the perianth as a whole. In case of flowers with two or more perianth whorls, species are considered actinomorphic if all whorls are actinomorphic and as zygomorphic if one or more whorls are zygomorphic. Trait is not applicable when the perianth is missing. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '207. Symmetry of perianth (D1)')

 - *disymmetric*: Perianth with two orthogonal planes of bilateral symmetry
 - *zygomorphic*: Monosymmetric, with a single plane of bilateral symmetry


## flower_perianth_phyllotaxis


- label: Perianth phyllotaxis
- description: Perianth phyllotaxis at anthesis. Perianth parts may be organised in one or more whorls or along a continuous spiral, usually with wide divergence angles more or less equal to 137.5 degrees. Less frequently, perianth phyllotaxis may be irregular. Perianth phyllotaxis at anthesis may differ from phyllotaxis of perianth part primordia at their inception and it is not uncommon that spirally initiated perianths become whorled later through development. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '230. Perianth phyllotaxy (D1)', with more information of differentiating between trait values in this manuscript.)

## flower_perianth_differentiation


- label: Perianth differentiation
- description: The ways in which perianth organs may look different from each other in a given flower. Typically, outer perianth parts are sepaloid and protect the other floral organs during floral development, while inner organs are often petaloid and play a role in pollinator attraction (Endress, 1994). However, it is also possible that all parts are either sepaloid or petaloid but remain differentiated in shape, size, and/or texture. In case of spiral perianths, differentiation may be continuous (i.e., gradual), whereby two successively initiated organs are very similar or only slightly different, while the outermost and innermost organs at both ends of the spiral are very different from each other (e.g., Chimonanthus). In the special case of perianths consisting of a single whorl, they are scored as undifferentiated. This perianth differentiation trait may be seen as both functional (the parting vs. sharing of functions among perianth parts) and developmental (the expression of a genetic program for different forms of perianth parts vs. a single program for a single type of perianth part morphology). Within-whorl differentiation, whereby organs of the same whorl take different forms, is common in zygomorphic flowers (e.g., Balsaminaceae, Fabaceae, Orchidaceae) but is not taken into account with this trait. This trait is not applicable when the perianth is absent. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '234. Perianth differentiation (D1)')

## flower_filament


- label: Filament presence and shape
- description: Trait that considers the absence or presence of the filament, and in the latter case, the shape of the filament. Shape is considered in terms of length and width and is defined in relation to anther length/width. The width of the filament may thus either be broad as in laminar (e.g., Eupomatiaceae) or bulky stamens (e.g., Chloranthaceae), or narrow (filamentous) as found in many core eudicots groups (e.g., Rosaceae). This trait is considered inapplicable when filaments are entirely fused with each other or to the perianth. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '305. Filament (D1)')
- number of records: 204
- number of studies: 1

## flower_filament_fusion


- label: Fusion of filaments
- description: Fusion of stamen (and staminode) filaments among each other at anthesis (congenitally or postgenitally) is recorded on a continuous scale, from 0 (free filaments) to 1 (filaments fused along their entire length). Partial fusion is recorded using an approximate number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the length of filaments).

## flower_filament_fusion_to_inner_perianth


- label: Fusion of filaments to inner perianth series
- description: The fusion of filaments with the innermost perianth organs at anthesis on a continuous scale, from 0 (filaments completely free from perianth) to 1 (filaments fused along their entire length with the perianth; the “entire length” of the filament is defined as the distance between the floral base and the joint between filament and anther). Partial fusion is recorded using an approximate number between these two extremes (e.g., 0.1 corresponds to basal fusion, 0.5 to fusion along half of the length of perianth parts). If two (or more) stamen whorls (including staminodial whorls) differ in their extent of filament fusion with the perianth, this trait is recorded as a range of values. For example, if the filaments of an outermost stamen whorl are fused, up to 90% of their length, but an inner whorl only up to 50%, the trait is assigned a range of 0.5 to 0.9. The rationale for this is to provide a general trait that allows comparison of fusion among all angiosperms. (Definition derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '308. Fusion of filaments to inner perianth series (C1)')

The two microsporangia of a theca usually release their pollen grains through a common opening (stomium). Often, it is difficult to establish anther orientation clearly in a flower as this is a gradual feature with many intermediate stages. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al.

## flower_structural_carpels_count


- label: CNumber of structural carpels
- description: Number of fertile or sterile carpels in bisexual or female flowers, recorded as a continuous character (with integer values of 1 and above). Includes the number of co-occurring carpellodes (sterile carpels) because this number is often more easily obtained from the literature than the actual number of fertile carpels. However, the number of carpellodes in male flowers is ignored for this character. In multicarpellate, unilocular gynoecia with complete carpel fusion up to the stigma (e.g., Primula), it may be difficult to assess the number of carpels unequivocally. In such cases, the number of carpels is scored only if it is well established based on anatomical or developmental investigations. Similarly, in gynoecia where one or more carpels are reduced (e.g., in the pseudomonomerous gynoecia of some Arecaceae, Stauffer et al., 2002), the total number of structural carpels is only scored when unequivocally determined in the literature.

## flower_gynoecium_placentation


- label: Placentation
- description: The different types of placentation in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia. In apocarpous and unicarpellate gynoecia, placentation is often described as marginal as the ovules are usually attached along the ventral slit (i.e., the zone where the carpel margins become postgenitally closed during carpel development). In syncarpous gynoecia there are three main types of placentation, 1) axile placentation refers to ovaries where the ovules are placed in the angle between carpel flanks in the center of the ovary; 2) in ovaries with parietal placentation the ovules attach to the ovary wall where two carpels meet; 3) in ovaries with free-central placentation the ovules are attached to a central column that emerges from the base of the ovary and protrudes into the non-septate ovary. It is not unusual that syncarpous gynoecia show a transition from proximally axile to a distally parietal placentation (e.g., Polemoniaceae). Basal and apical placentation may occur both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia. Usually there is one longitudinal series of ovules attached to each carpel margin. However, both in apocarpous/unicarpellate and in syncarpous gynoecia there may be more than one series of ovules at the flanks of a carpel. These latter cases are referred to as laminar (or laminar-diffuse) placentation (e.g., in some Nymphaeaceae). A placenta that is protruding from its surroundings and has more than two series of ovules (either axile or parietal) is called protruding-diffuse. (Definition and trait values derived from Schoenenberger et al. (2020)  for their character '412. Placentation (D1)')

## flower_pollen_aperture_shape


- label: Pollen grain aperture shape
- description: Pollen grains are often described according to the shape, structure, and position of their apertures. This trait describes the main shape of the many described aperture types. Aperture terminology is partly determined by the position of the aperture on the pollen grain (either at the pole or at the equator) and pollen grain polarity, in turn, is determined by the spatial orientation of the microspore in the meiotic tetrad.
